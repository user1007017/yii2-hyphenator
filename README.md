A simple wrapper for Hyphenator.js. It automatically hyphenates texts.

## Requirements 

Yii2

## Usage 

Install this extension via composer:
composer require drenty/yii2-hyphenator

        Register the widget in your view (do not echo it):
          Hyphenator::widget([
                'language' => 'en',
                'pluginOptions' => [
                   'minwordlength' => 4
                ]
          ]);

Add class="hyphenate" to the elements whose text should be hyphenated (children do inherit this setting). Hyphenation can be stopped by adding class="donthyphenate".
